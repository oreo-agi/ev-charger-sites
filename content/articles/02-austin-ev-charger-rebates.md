## Quick Summary: Available Incentives for Austin Homeowners

Here's what you can potentially save on a home EV charger installation:

Let's dive into each program and how to claim them.

## Federal Tax Credit: Your Biggest Savings

### The Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit

This is the most valuable incentive available to Austin homeowners—a **30% tax credit** on your total EV charger costs, including both equipment and installation.

**Maximum benefit:** $1,000 per charger installation

**What's covered:**
- ✅ The charger hardware (EVSE)
- ✅ Installation labor costs
- ✅ Electrical panel upgrades (if needed for the charger)
- ✅ Wiring, conduit, and materials
- ✅ Permits and inspection fees
- ✅ Trenching for detached garages

**What's NOT covered:**
- ❌ The electric vehicle itself (separate EV tax credit exists)
- ❌ Electrical upgrades unrelated to the charger
- ❌ Charging sessions (electricity costs)

### Real-World Savings Examples

**Example 1: Standard Installation**
- Charger: $700
- Installation: $1,200
- Total qualifying costs: $1,900
- Tax credit (30%): **$570**

**Example 2: With Panel Upgrade**
- Charger: $650
- Panel upgrade: $3,200
- Installation & materials: $800
- Total qualifying costs: $4,650
- Tax credit (30%): $1,395
- **Maximum credit: $1,000** (capped)

**Example 3: Simple Install**
- Charger: $500
- Installation: $600
- Total qualifying costs: $1,100
- Tax credit (30%): **$330**

### Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the federal tax credit, you must:

**✓ Property requirements:**
- Be the property owner (not renting)
- Install at your primary or secondary residence
- Charger must be for personal use (not business/rental)

**✓ Technical requirements:**
- Charger must be new (not used/refurbished)
- Must be installed in the United States
- Original use begins with you (first owner of the charger)

**✓ Tax requirements:**
- Have tax liability to offset (it's non-refundable)
- File IRS Form 8911 with your tax return

**Austin homeowners note:** You can claim this credit whether you live in Austin proper, Cedar Park, Round Rock, Pflugerville, or any surrounding community—as long as it's your residence.

### How to Claim the Federal Tax Credit

**Step 1: Keep detailed receipts**

Save documentation for:
- Charger purchase receipt (showing make, model, price)
- Electrician invoice (itemized showing labor, materials, permits)
- Before/after photos of installation
- Product specifications proving it's an EV charger

**Step 2: Complete IRS Form 8911**

Download Form 8911 ("Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit") when filing taxes:
- Part I, Line 1: Enter your total qualified costs
- Part I, Line 2: Calculate 30% (or let tax software do it)
- Line 4: Limited to $1,000 maximum
- Transfer the credit to your Form 1040

**Step 3: File with your tax return**

- Claim for the tax year the charger was *placed in service* (installed and operational)
- Example: Installed in November 2026 = claim on your 2026 taxes (filed April 2027)
- Non-refundable credit = reduces tax owed, but won't create a refund
- Unused credit can be carried forward to future tax years

**Austin CPA tip:** If you're unsure about tax implications, consult a local Austin tax professional. Many have experience with EV credits now that adoption is growing in Travis County.

### Common Federal Tax Credit Questions

**Q: Can I claim this if I install two chargers?**
A: No, the $1,000 limit is per household location, not per charger. Installing two chargers doesn't double the credit.

**Q: What if I install in 2026 but don't owe taxes?**
A: The credit is non-refundable, so it can only offset taxes owed. However, you can carry forward the unused portion to future years.

**Q: Does it apply to rentals I own?**
A: Not for residential rental properties. There's a separate, smaller business property credit for commercial use.

**Q: What if my installation costs $2,500 but only $1,000 is for the charger-related work?**
A: Only include costs directly related to the EV charger installation. If you're doing a whole electrical panel upgrade for other reasons, only the portion needed for the charger qualifies.

## How to Maximize Your Total Savings

### Strategy 1: Stack Everything

**Scenario: Austin Energy customer, $2,000 installation**

1. Federal tax credit (30%): -$600
2. Austin Energy rebate: -$300
3. Manufacturer promotion: -$100
4. Total savings: **$1,000 (50%)**
5. Net cost: **$1,000**

### Strategy 2: Time-of-Use Rate Optimization

Beyond installation rebates, save long-term:

**Annual charging costs comparison:**
- Standard rate (12,000 mi/year): ~$520/year
- Time-of-use rate (same miles): ~$280/year
- **Annual savings: $240**

Over 5 years: **$1,200 in electricity savings**

### Strategy 3: Plan Electrical Work Together

If you're doing any electrical upgrades:
- Combine panel upgrade with charger installation
- Single permit, single electrician visit
- The entire upgrade can qualify for tax credit (if needed for the charger)

**Example:**
- Panel upgrade you were planning anyway: $3,500
- Add EV charger circuit: +$600
- Total: $4,100
- Federal credit: **$1,000** (max)
- Effectively reduces panel upgrade cost to $3,100

### Strategy 4: Buy Smart, Install Smarter

**Timing tips:**
- Black Friday/Cyber Monday: Chargers often 15-20% off
- Spring installation: Electricians less busy than summer peak
- Bundle with solar installation: Some companies offer package discounts
- Get multiple bids: 20-30% price variation common among Austin electricians

## Important Deadlines & Expiration Dates

### Federal Tax Credit

**Current status (2026):** 
- Extended through December 31, 2032 (under current law)
- 30% rate through 2032
- Could change with future legislation

**Action item:** While the credit is currently secure, install sooner rather than later—policies can change.

### Austin Energy Programs

**Typical cycle:**
- Programs funded annually/biennially
- Can run out of funding mid-year
- "First come, first served" typically
- Reapply each budget cycle if needed

**Pro tip:** Apply for Austin Energy rebates in Q1-Q2 (January-June) when budgets are fresh. Programs sometimes run out of funding by Q4.

## Application Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Common errors that delay rebates:**

1. **Incomplete documentation**
   - Missing itemized invoice
   - No photo of installation
   - Receipts don't show installation date

2. **Non-qualifying equipment**
   - Choosing a charger not on approved list
   - Installing Level 1 when Level 2 required
   - Non-networked charger when smart charger required

3. **Wrong account information**
   - Applying under wrong Austin Energy account number
   - Installation address doesn't match service address

4. **DIY installation**
   - Most programs require licensed electrician installation
   - Permit and inspection documentation required

5. **Timing issues**
   - Filing too early (before final inspection)
   - Filing too late (missing deadlines)
   - Claiming wrong tax year

**Solution:** Work with an experienced Austin EV charger installer who knows the rebate requirements and can help with documentation.
