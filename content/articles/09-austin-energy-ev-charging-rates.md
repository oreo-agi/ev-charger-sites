# Austin Energy EV Charging Rates: How to Save $800+/Year on Home Charging

If you charge your EV at home in Austin, you're already saving money compared to gas. But most Austin EV owners are leaving significant savings on the table by charging at the wrong time of day.

Austin Energy — the city-owned utility serving most of Austin — offers **Time-of-Use (TOU) rate plans** specifically designed to reward EV owners who shift their charging to off-peak hours. The price difference between peak and off-peak electricity in Austin can be dramatic: up to **60% cheaper** per kilowatt-hour.

This guide covers everything you need to know about Austin Energy's EV charging rates: which plan to choose, when to charge, and how to automate it all so you save money without thinking about it.

---

## What Are Austin Energy's Time-of-Use (TOU) Rates?

Standard electric rates charge the same price per kWh regardless of when you use electricity. **Time-of-Use rates** charge different prices depending on the time of day and season.

The logic: electricity is expensive when demand is high (hot summer afternoons when everyone runs their AC), and cheap when demand is low (late night, early morning). By shifting energy-intensive activities like EV charging to off-peak hours, you save money while helping the grid.

### Austin Energy's Current Rate Plans

## How Much Can You Save? The Math

Let's run real numbers for an Austin EV owner driving a typical EV:

### Example: 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range
- **Battery capacity:** 82 kWh
- **Estimated efficiency:** 3.5 miles/kWh
- **Weekly driving:** 250 miles (Austin average commuter)
- **Weekly charging needed:** ~71 kWh

**Scenario A: Charging on Standard Rate (~$0.11/kWh)**
- Weekly cost: 71 kWh × $0.11 = **$7.81**
- Annual cost: **$406/year**

**Scenario B: Charging at Peak Hours (~$0.20/kWh)**
- Weekly cost: 71 kWh × $0.20 = **$14.20**
- Annual cost: **$738/year**

**Scenario C: Charging Off-Peak (TOU Rate, ~$0.06/kWh)**
- Weekly cost: 71 kWh × $0.06 = **$4.26**
- Annual cost: **$221/year**

**The difference:** Charging at peak vs. off-peak TOU = **$517/year in savings**. Switch from peak rate to off-peak TOU and you save significantly — some high-mileage drivers save $800–$1,200/year.

### What About vs. Gasoline?

For comparison, that same Tesla driving 13,000 miles/year in Austin:
- **Gas equivalent** (30 mpg at $3.20/gallon): ~$1,387/year in fuel
- **EV at peak TOU rate:** ~$738/year
- **EV at off-peak TOU rate:** ~$221/year

Even at worst-case (peak rate), you're saving ~$650/year vs. gas. At optimized off-peak charging, you save **$1,166/year** vs. gas.

## Austin Energy Peak vs. Off-Peak Hours (2026)

Mark these hours on your calendar:

### Summer (June – September) — Most Critical
| Time Window | Rate Type | When to Charge? |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 12 AM – 7 AM | Super Off-Peak | ✅ Best time to charge |
| 7 AM – 3 PM | Off-Peak | ✅ Good option |
| 3 PM – 8 PM | **Peak** | ❌ Avoid — most expensive |
| 8 PM – Midnight | Off-Peak | ✅ Okay |

**Austin summer tip:** The 3–8 PM window is when Austin's grid is most stressed (AC everywhere, solar output dropping). Austin Energy charges premium prices during this window. Never charge during this window in summer.

### Winter (October – May)
| Time Window | Rate Type | When to Charge? |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 12 AM – 6 AM | Super Off-Peak | ✅ Best time to charge |
| 6 AM – 9 AM | **Peak** | ❌ Avoid |
| 9 AM – 6 PM | Off-Peak | ✅ Good option |
| 6 PM – 9 PM | **Peak** | ❌ Avoid |
| 9 PM – Midnight | Off-Peak | ✅ Good option |

### The Universal Austin EV Charging Rule
**Charge between midnight and 6 AM.** This is super off-peak year-round, gives you the cheapest rate, and takes advantage of your car sitting idle anyway.

## How to Set Up Scheduled Charging

The good news: you almost certainly don't need to manually plug in at midnight. Every major EV and Level 2 charger supports scheduled charging.

### Tesla
1. Open your car's touchscreen: Charging → Schedule
2. Set start time: **12:00 AM or 2:00 AM** (allows buffer)
3. Set "Charge Limit" to 80–90% for daily driving (100% only for road trips)
4. **Using Tesla app:** Energy → Charging Schedule → Set departure time, let car work backward

**Better option: Austin Energy off-peak mode**
Some Austin Energy chargers (including certain ChargePoint models) integrate with Austin Energy's grid signals to automatically charge during off-peak. Ask your installer about "smart charging" compatible hardware.

### Other EVs (BMW, Hyundai, Rivian, Ford, GM)
- **BMW iX/i4:** Settings → Charging → Scheduled Departure
- **Hyundai Ioniq 5/6:** Settings → Charge Timer
- **Rivian R1T/R1S:** Charging → Schedule
- **Ford F-150 Lightning/Mustang Mach-E:** FordPass app → Charging Schedule
- **GM (Chevy Bolt, Silverado EV):** myChevrolet app → Vehicle → Charge Settings

### Level 2 Charger Scheduling
If your charger has a smart app (ChargePoint, JuiceBox, Wallbox, etc.), you can set charging schedules directly in the charger — useful if you have multiple EVs or rent and can't change car settings.

## Choosing the Right Austin Energy Rate Plan

### Should You Switch to TOU?

**Switch if:**
- You can charge between 12 AM – 6 AM consistently
- You drive 100+ miles/week (high charging frequency amplifies savings)
- Your EV supports scheduled charging (all modern EVs do)
- You have a Level 2 charger (faster charging, more flexible timing)

**Stick with standard rate if:**
- Your schedule is unpredictable and you sometimes need to charge at peak hours
- You mostly use public charging (work, shopping center)
- You're a renter without a Level 2 charger (limited charging flexibility)

### How to Switch Rate Plans
1. Log into your Austin Energy account at austinenergy.com
2. Navigate to Account → Rate Options
3. Review the current TOU rate schedule
4. Select "Value Rate with TOU" or request Rider EV
5. Changes typically take effect next billing cycle

**Call option:** Austin Energy customer service at 512-494-9400 can walk you through your options and run an estimate based on your current usage.

## The Rider EV Program: Is It Worth It?

Austin Energy's **Rider EV** program offers a specially discounted rate for EV charging — but it requires more setup.

### How Rider EV Works
- A **separate meter or sub-meter** is installed for your EV charger circuit
- The EV charging is billed at the Rider EV rate (heavily discounted off-peak)
- Your home's other electricity is billed at the standard rate
- Austin Energy may provide a **free Level 2 charger** as part of the program (check current availability)

### Rider EV Costs & Savings
- **Setup cost:** $300–800 for separate circuit installation (often offset by rebate + free charger)
- **Monthly savings:** $40–80/month for typical Austin EV driver
- **Annual savings:** $480–960/year
- **Payback period:** 6–18 months

### Rider EV Requirements
- You must be an Austin Energy residential customer
- Your charger must be on a dedicated circuit (standard best practice anyway)
- Application through Austin Energy (sometimes has waitlist)

**Bottom line:** If you drive a lot and plan to stay in your Austin home for 2+ years, Rider EV can be worth the setup cost. The payback period is fast.

## Best EV Chargers for Austin Energy TOU Rate Optimization

Not all chargers are equally good at TOU rate optimization. Here's what to look for in Austin:

### Features That Maximize TOU Savings

**Smart scheduling:** Must-have. The charger app lets you set charge windows (e.g., 12 AM–6 AM only). Even if your car already does this, charger-side scheduling is a backup.

**Demand response compatibility:** Some Austin Energy programs allow your charger to receive grid signals and pause during peak events (rare in Austin today, but coming). ChargePoint and JuiceBox support this.

**Energy monitoring:** Real-time kWh tracking lets you verify you're charging at the right rate. Important for Rider EV billing verification.

**Load balancing (for multi-car households):** If you have two EVs, smart chargers like Wallbox Quasar 2 or ChargePoint Home Flex with load sharing prevent blowing your circuit.

### Top Chargers for Austin TOU Optimization

| Charger | Price (Hardware) | Smart Features | Austin Energy Eligible? |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| ChargePoint Home Flex | $699 | Excellent app, demand response ready | ✅ Yes |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I charge my EV at Austin Energy public charging stations?
Yes. Austin Energy operates public Level 2 chargers at select locations around Austin (City Hall garage, community centers, etc.). These are typically free or low-cost. However, for daily charging, home charging at TOU rates will be much cheaper than most public stations.

### What if I have solar panels? Should I still worry about TOU rates?
Yes — and TOU rates can actually work *against* you with solar if not configured correctly. Austin Energy's net metering pays you a set rate for excess solar exported to the grid. But if you import electricity at peak rates, you might pay more than you earn from solar. Optimize by charging from stored battery (if you have a Powerwall) or overnight. Talk to your solar installer about TOU integration.

### Does Austin Energy's TOU rate apply on weekends?
For most residential plans, weekends are typically off-peak all day. This means Saturday and Sunday charging is cheap regardless of time — a good opportunity to top off before the work week.

### How do I know if my charger is charging at the right time?
Check your Austin Energy bill — it breaks down usage by TOU period (peak vs. off-peak kWh). You can also use your charger's app (if it has energy monitoring) to see exactly when charging occurred and calculate your per-session cost.

### What's the penalty if I accidentally charge during peak hours?
There's no penalty — you just pay the higher peak rate for that session. With scheduled charging properly set up, accidental peak charging is rare. But if you need an emergency charge during peak hours, you can override the schedule.
