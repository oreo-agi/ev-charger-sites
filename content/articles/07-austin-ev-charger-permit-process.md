## Do You Need a Permit?

In Austin, **yes, you need an electrical permit** for EV charger installation in almost all cases.

### When Permits Are Required
You'll need a permit if you're:
- Installing a dedicated 240V circuit for a Level 2 EV charger
- Upgrading your electrical panel to accommodate EV charging
- Running new wiring from your panel to your garage or carport
- Installing a wall-mounted or hardwired EV charger
- Adding a NEMA 14-50 outlet specifically for EV charging

### When Permits Might Not Be Required
The only scenario where you might not need a permit:
- Using an existing 240V outlet (like for a dryer) temporarily with a portable Level 2 charger
- Simple plug-in to existing outlet (no new electrical work)

**Important:** Even if you're using existing wiring, it's smart to have a licensed electrician verify the circuit can safely handle continuous EV charging loads. Most dryer circuits aren't rated for continuous 30-40 amp draws.

## Austin Permit Requirements

Austin follows the **2023 National Electrical Code (NEC)** with local amendments. Here's what the city requires for residential EV charger permits:

### Electrical Code Requirements
1. **Circuit Rating:**
   - Minimum 40-amp dedicated circuit for most Level 2 chargers
   - 50-60 amp circuits for high-powered chargers (Tesla Wall Connector, etc.)
   
2. **GFCI Protection:**
   - Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter required for all EV charging equipment
   - Can be in the charger itself or at the circuit breaker
   
3. **Dedicated Circuit:**
   - EV charger must be on its own circuit
   - Cannot share with other appliances or outlets
   
4. **Proper Grounding:**
   - Equipment grounding conductor required
   - Follows NEC Article 625 for EV power equipment

5. **Overcurrent Protection:**
   - Circuit breaker sized appropriately for wire gauge and charger load
   - Typically 40-50 amp breaker for residential installations

### Austin-Specific Requirements
- **Licensed Electrician:** Work must be performed by a Texas-licensed electrician
- **Energy Code Compliance:** Must meet Austin Energy Green Building requirements where applicable
- **HOA Approval:** If in an HOA, get written approval before applying for permits (city may request documentation)

## Step-by-Step Application Process

Here's exactly how to get your EV charger permit in Austin:

### Step 1: Hire a Licensed Electrician (Recommended)
**Timeline:** 1-3 days to get quotes

While you *can* apply for permits yourself if you're a homeowner doing DIY electrical work, we strongly recommend hiring a licensed electrician. Here's why:

- Licensed electricians in Austin typically pull permits as part of their service
- They know local code requirements and inspection standards
- They handle all paperwork and scheduling
- Inspection pass rates are much higher with professional installations
- Your insurance may require licensed work for liability coverage

**Cost savings from DIY permits are minimal compared to the risk of failed inspections or code violations.**

### Step 2: Gather Required Information
**Timeline:** Same day

Before applying, collect:
- Property address and parcel number (from TCAD website)
- Homeowner contact information
- Electrician license number (if hiring one)
- EV charger specifications (amperage, voltage, manufacturer)
- Current electrical panel details (amps, available space)
- Property survey or site plan (for outdoor installations)

### Step 3: Submit Permit Application
**Timeline:** 15-30 minutes online, or in-person visit

You have two options for applying:

#### Option A: Online Application (Recommended)
1. Go to [Austin Build + Connect portal](https://abc.austintexas.gov/)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Select "Residential" → "Electrical Permit"
4. Fill out permit application:
   - Property details
   - Scope of work description
   - Contractor information
   - Load calculations
5. Upload required documents
6. Pay permit fee online
7. Submit application

**Pro Tip:** Applications submitted before 2 PM usually get reviewed same-day or next business day.

#### Option B: In-Person Application
Visit the Residential Plan Review Center:
- **Location:** 6310 Wilhelmina Delco Drive, Austin, TX 78752
- **Hours:** Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM
- Bring all documents in paper form
- Pay with check, cash, or card
- Get permit number same-day for simple installations

### Step 4: Permit Review
**Timeline:** 1-5 business days

City of Austin reviewers will check your application for:
- Code compliance
- Completeness of documentation
- Load calculations accuracy
- Proper equipment specifications

**Fast-Track Option:** Simple residential EV charger permits often qualify for express review (approved within 24-48 hours) if all documentation is complete and meets code.

### Step 5: Receive Permit Approval
**Timeline:** Same day as approval

Once approved, you'll receive:
- Permit number
- Approved plan set (stamped)
- Inspection requirements
- Permit placard (to post at installation site)

**Important:** Keep your permit number handy. You'll need it to schedule inspections.

### Step 6: Schedule Rough-In Inspection (If Applicable)
**Timeline:** 1-3 days wait for inspector

If your installation involves running new wiring through walls or underground:
1. Call Austin Development Services: (512) 978-4000
2. Request "electrical rough-in inspection"
3. Provide permit number and preferred date
4. Inspector will verify wiring before it's covered up

**Not all EV charger installations need rough-in inspections.** If your electrician is running surface conduit in a garage, you may only need a final inspection.

### Step 7: Complete Installation
**Timeline:** 4-8 hours for most installations

Your electrician will:
- Install circuit breaker in panel
- Run wiring to charger location
- Mount EV charger
- Make all electrical connections
- Test system operation
- Ensure all code requirements are met

**Do not use the charger before final inspection and approval.**

### Step 8: Schedule Final Inspection

Once installation is complete:
1. Call (512) 978-4000 or schedule online via Austin Build + Connect
2. Request "electrical final inspection"
3. Provide permit number
4. Choose inspection date (usually 1-3 day lead time)

**Inspection Tips:**
- Be present or have your electrician there to answer questions
- Make sure permit placard is visible at work site
- Have charger accessible (not blocked by vehicles)
- Keep approved plans on-site for inspector reference

### Step 9: Pass Final Inspection
**Timeline:** 30-60 minutes for inspector visit

The inspector will verify:
- Circuit breaker properly sized and installed
- Wiring meets code (gauge, type, routing)
- GFCI protection present and functional
- Charger properly mounted and grounded
- No violations of NEC or local code
- Work matches approved permit plans

**If you pass:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from others' permit mistakes to save time and money:

### Mistake #1: Starting Work Before Permit Approval
**Problem:** Installing charger before permit is issued
**Consequence:** 
- Inspector can require removal and reinstallation
- Potential fines ($500-1,000)
- Work must be exposed for inspection even if complete

**Solution:** Wait for permit approval before starting any electrical work.

### Mistake #2: Incomplete Load Calculations
**Problem:** Not showing panel has capacity for EV charger load
**Consequence:** 
- Permit application rejected
- Delays of 3-7 days to resubmit
- May require expensive panel upgrade

**Solution:** Have electrician perform proper load calculation before applying. If panel is close to capacity, plan for upgrade from the start.

### Mistake #3: Wrong Wire Gauge
**Problem:** Using 10 AWG wire for 50-amp circuit (should be 6 AWG)
**Consequence:**
- Inspection failure
- Rewiring required ($300-800)
- Re-inspection needed

**Solution:** Follow NEC Table 310.16 for conductor sizing. When in doubt, go one size larger than minimum.

### Mistake #4: Missing GFCI Protection
**Problem:** Installing charger without required ground fault protection
**Consequence:**
- Failed inspection
- GFCI breaker purchase and installation ($150-250)
- Safety hazard

**Solution:** Use GFCI circuit breaker or verify charger has built-in GFCI. Check manufacturer specs.

### Mistake #5: Forgetting HOA Approval
**Problem:** Getting permit before HOA approval
**Consequence:**
- HOA may deny after permit issued
- Wasted permit fee
- Delayed installation

**Solution:** Get HOA architectural approval **before** applying for city permit. Some HOAs take 30-60 days to approve.

### Mistake #6: Not Posting Permit Placard
**Problem:** Permit not visible at job site during inspection
**Consequence:**
- Inspector may not perform inspection
- Rescheduling required (adds 1-5 days)

**Solution:** Post permit placard in window or on garage door where inspector can easily see it.

### Mistake #7: Installing in Wrong Location
**Problem:** Charger installed somewhere other than permitted location
**Consequence:**
- Inspection failure
- May require permit amendment
- Possible relocation ($400-1,200)

**Solution:** Stick to the location shown on approved plans. If you need to change location, request permit amendment before installation.

## Working with Licensed Electricians

Hiring the right electrician makes the permit process smooth. Here's what to look for:

### Qualifications to Verify

**1. Texas Electrical Contractor License**
- Required for all permitted electrical work in Austin
- Verify at [Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/)

### Questions to Ask Your Electrician

**About Permits:**
- "Do you pull permits as part of your service?"
- "What's your typical permit approval timeline?"
- "How many EV charger permits have you done in Austin?"
- "What's your inspection pass rate?"

**About Installation:**
- "Does my panel need upgrading?"
- "What wire gauge will you use?"
- "Where will the GFCI protection be?"
- "How long until I can use the charger after installation?"

**About Costs:**
- "Is the permit fee included in your quote?"
- "What happens if we fail inspection?"
- "Are there any potential additional costs I should know about?"

### What Should Be Included in Quote

A comprehensive electrician quote should include:
- ✅ Permit application and fees
- ✅ All materials (wire, conduit, breaker, etc.)
- ✅ Labor for installation
- ✅ Inspection scheduling and attendance
- ✅ Any necessary panel modifications
- ✅ Warranty on workmanship (typically 1 year)

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "We don't need a permit for this"
- ❌ Permit fee charged separately without explanation
- ❌ No mention of inspections in quote
- ❌ Unwilling to provide license number

### Permit Responsibility

**Who pulls the permit matters:**

**Electrician Pulls Permit (Recommended):**
- They handle all paperwork
- They schedule inspections
- They're present for inspections
- They're responsible for code compliance
- **Your responsibility:** Pay their invoice

**Homeowner Pulls Permit (DIY):**
- You handle all applications
- You schedule inspections
- You must be present for inspections
- You're responsible for code compliance
- **Electrician's responsibility:** Perform work to code

**Bottom line:** Unless you're very confident in electrical work and permitting processes, let your electrician handle permits. The small additional cost ($0-100) is worth the peace of mind.
