# HOA EV Charger Installation in Austin: Your Rights, Rules & How to Get Approved

If you live in an Austin HOA or condo community and want to install a home EV charger, you've probably hit a wall — literally and figuratively. HOA boards can seem like gatekeepers to your garage outlet, and confusing CC&R language can make it feel impossible.

Here's the good news: **Texas law is firmly on your side.**

This guide covers everything you need to know about HOA EV charger installation in Austin — your legal rights, how to request HOA approval (and what to do if they say no), costs, and how to find a licensed electrician experienced with HOA installs.

---

## Texas Law Protects Your Right to Install an EV Charger

Before you even draft your HOA request letter, know this: **Texas Property Code § 202.014** gives homeowners the right to install EV charging equipment in their own garage or parking space — regardless of what the HOA says.

### What the Law Says

Enacted in 2021, Texas Property Code § 202.014 prohibits HOA deed restrictions from banning or unreasonably restricting:

- The installation of EV charging equipment in a **privately owned garage or parking space**
- The use of EV charging equipment on your own property

This means your HOA **cannot flatly refuse** your request to install a Level 2 charger in your attached garage or your assigned parking spot.

### What the HOA Can Still Control

The law doesn't give you unlimited power. Your HOA can still:

- **Require prior written approval** before installation
- **Set reasonable standards** for aesthetics (wire routing, charger brand/color)
- **Require a licensed electrician** and permit (as required by the City of Austin anyway)
- **Require you to carry liability insurance** for the charger
- **Set hours of operation** for shared or common-area charging equipment
- **Require compliance** with the NEC (National Electrical Code) and local codes

What they **cannot** do:
- Flat-out ban EV chargers in private spaces
- Charge you unreasonable fees for the right to install
- Impose requirements so burdensome that installation becomes effectively impossible
- Require HOA approval that takes more than 60 days (§ 202.014 includes a 60-day default approval rule if the HOA doesn't respond)

### The 60-Day Default Approval Rule

This is important: if you submit a proper written request to your HOA and they **don't respond within 60 days**, the request is **automatically deemed approved** under Texas law.

Keep copies of everything you submit, send via certified mail if possible, and document the dates carefully.

## Step-by-Step: How to Get HOA Approval in Austin

Even with the law on your side, a cooperative approach usually gets faster results. Here's how to navigate the process:

### Step 1: Review Your CC&Rs and Rules

Before submitting anything, read your:

- **Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs)** — the governing document
- **Architectural Control Committee (ACC) rules** — typically has a separate approval process
- **HOA bylaws** — may have submission procedures

Look specifically for:
- Any existing EV charger policies (more HOAs are adding these)
- Architectural review requirements
- Electrical modification rules
- Garage alteration procedures

If your CC&Rs have a blanket prohibition on EV chargers, you can cite Texas § 202.014 — that restriction is unenforceable.

### Step 2: Gather Your Documentation

Before submitting, prepare:

**Technical Documentation:**
- Site plan showing where the charger will be installed
- Electrical plan from a licensed Austin electrician (showing circuit, amperage, wire routing)
- Spec sheet for your chosen charger (brand, model, dimensions, output)
- Copy of required Austin/Travis County electrical permit

**Insurance Documentation:**
- Confirmation that your homeowner's policy covers the equipment (call your insurer)
- Some HOAs require a certificate of liability insurance — most policies already cover this

**Contractor Documentation:**
- License number of your electrician (verify at Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation)
- Insurance certificates for the electrician

### Step 3: Write Your Request Letter

A formal, professional request letter goes a long way. Here's a template:

---

**[Date]**

**[HOA Board / Architectural Control Committee]**
**[HOA Name]**
**[HOA Address]**

**Subject: Request for Approval — EV Charging Equipment Installation**

Dear [HOA Board / ACC],

I am writing to request approval for the installation of an electric vehicle (EV) charging station at my property located at [Your Address].

**Installation Summary:**
- **Charger:** [Brand and Model, e.g., ChargePoint Home Flex 50A]
- **Location:** Interior of my private attached garage / My assigned parking space [#]
- **Electrician:** [Licensed Electrician Name, License #XXXXXXXX]
- **Permit:** Austin/Travis County electrical permit will be obtained prior to installation
- **Installation Date Requested:** [Date Range]

**Why I'm Requesting This:**
I recently purchased an electric vehicle and need a reliable home charging solution. A Level 2 charger reduces overnight charging time from 20+ hours (standard outlet) to 4-6 hours, which is essential for my daily commute.

**Legal Note:**
I want to note respectfully that Texas Property Code § 202.014 protects homeowners' rights to install EV charging equipment in privately owned garages and parking spaces. I am confident this installation will comply with all applicable codes and your reasonable guidelines.

**Enclosed Documentation:**
- Site plan and electrical diagram
- Charger specifications
- Electrician license and insurance
- HOA homeowner's insurance confirmation

I am happy to meet with the ACC to discuss any questions or modifications. I look forward to your response within 60 days as provided under Texas law.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Unit/Lot Number]
[Phone / Email]

### Step 4: Submit via Certified Mail (and Email)

Send your request:
1. **Via certified mail** with return receipt requested — creates a legal paper trail
2. **Also via email** to the HOA management company (document the date sent)
3. Keep copies of everything

The 60-day clock starts from the date of receipt.

### Step 5: Follow Up at the 30-Day Mark

If you haven't heard back in 30 days, send a polite follow-up. Reference your original submission date and the 60-day Texas law deadline.

### Step 6: If They Approve — Schedule Installation

Once approved (or after 60 days with no response), you're clear to proceed. Your electrician will:

1. Pull an electrical permit from the City of Austin
2. Install the dedicated 240V circuit and charger mount
3. Schedule the city electrical inspection
4. Provide you with the inspection approval document (keep this for your records and to show the HOA)

### Step 7: If They Deny — Know Your Options

If the HOA denies your request, ask them to put it in writing with specific reasons. Then:

1. **Evaluate the denial** — is it a "reasonable restriction" (aesthetics, safety) or an unenforceable ban?
2. **Consult a Texas real estate attorney** if you believe the denial violates § 202.014
3. **File a complaint** with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs if needed
4. **Negotiate** — sometimes an HOA will approve if you agree to minor modifications (e.g., specific wire routing, conduit color)

## HOA EV Charger Installation Costs in Austin

The costs for HOA installations are similar to regular residential installs, with a few potential additions:

### Typical Cost Range

| Scenario | Cost Estimate |
|----------|---------------|
| Simple garage install (attached home, panel nearby) | $800 – $1,500 |
| Longer run to panel, conduit required | $1,200 – $2,200 |
| Panel upgrade needed | Add $1,500 – $3,000 |
| Condo/townhouse (shared walls, more complex routing) | $1,500 – $3,000 |
| Multi-family unit (shared parking, metering needed) | $2,000 – $5,000+ |

### Additional HOA-Specific Costs

- **Permit fee (City of Austin):** $50 – $150
- **Electrician's HOA coordination fee:** Some electricians charge extra for providing detailed HOA documentation — budget $50-100
- **Conduit/aesthetics upgrade:** If HOA requires surface-mounted wiring to be in painted conduit matching your garage wall, add $100-300

### Available Rebates (Still Apply in HOA Scenarios)

Great news — **Austin Energy's Level 2 EV charger rebate of up to $1,200** applies whether you're in an HOA or not, as long as you own your unit and use an approved charger. Federal tax credit (30% up to $1,000) also applies.

See our [Austin EV charger rebates guide](/blog/austin-ev-charger-rebates) for details.

## Specific Scenarios: Condos, Townhouses, and Apartments

### Single-Family Homes in HOA Communities

This is the easiest scenario. If you have an attached garage and your own electrical panel, the law is clearly on your side and installation is straightforward. Most HOAs with attached single-family homes have approved EV charger policies by now.

**Timeline:** 2-6 weeks total (HOA approval + permit + install)

### Townhouses with Shared Walls

Townhouses can be tricky because:
- Electrical panels may be in a shared utility area
- Running conduit may cross shared walls or structures
- The HOA may have rules about structural modifications

**Key:** Get an electrician experienced with townhouse installs to evaluate before submitting your HOA request. You want to know the exact routing before you present to the HOA.

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks (longer if complex routing required or HOA has questions)

### Condos with Assigned Parking Spaces

This is the most complex scenario. If you have an **assigned parking space** (not a common area space), Texas § 202.014 applies and protects your right to install in that space.

Challenges:
- Running power from inside your unit to an outdoor parking space
- Electrical metering (the HOA may require sub-metering so you pay for only your electricity)
- Building permits for running conduit through common areas

**Options:**
1. **Portable/plug-in charger:** Some condos allow a 240V outlet installed in your parking space (no fixed charger mount)
2. **Fixed Level 2 charger:** Requires more HOA coordination but is more convenient
3. **Shared charging station:** Some Austin condo associations are installing shared chargers funded by the HOA — ask about this

**Timeline:** 6-12 weeks or more depending on HOA complexity

### Apartments (Renters)

If you rent in Austin, the situation is different:

- Texas § 202.014 applies to **homeowners**, not renters
- You'll need your **landlord's permission** and likely your property management company's approval
- Some Austin apartments are adding EV charging as an amenity — check if yours has plans
- **Portable Level 1 chargers** (standard 120V outlet) typically don't require approval

**Renter strategy:** Ask your landlord if they'd install a 240V outlet or EV charger as part of your unit — some will do it if you agree to a longer lease or pay for installation. The rebates can apply to landlords too.

## Finding an Electrician Experienced with HOA Installs

Not all electricians know how to navigate HOA requirements. You want someone who:

- Has experience documenting installations for HOA/architectural review committees
- Knows Austin Energy rebate program requirements
- Can provide the spec sheets and site plans HOAs typically require
- Is familiar with Austin's permit process for residential electrical work

**What to ask:**
- "Have you done HOA EV charger installations before?"
- "Can you provide the documentation package my HOA requires?"
- "Are you familiar with the Austin Energy rebate paperwork?"
- "How do you handle situations where the HOA has specific aesthetics requirements?"

## Austin Communities with Active EV Charger Policies

Many Austin HOAs have updated their governing documents to include EV charger policies. If you live in one of these larger Austin communities, check with your HOA office for their specific EV charger guidelines:

- **Mueller Community** — has had progressive EV policies since 2018
- **Steiner Ranch** — updated policies in 2023
- **The Domain area condos** — several have shared EV charging infrastructure
- **Barton Creek** — HOA updated policies in 2022

If your community isn't listed, it doesn't mean they don't have a policy — just call or email your HOA management company to ask for their current EV charger guidelines before submitting a formal request.

## Common HOA Objections — and How to Respond

### "We don't allow exterior modifications"

**Response:** Texas § 202.014 specifically overrides restrictions that would "prohibit or unreasonably restrict" EV charging equipment in private spaces. Installation in your private garage is not an exterior modification in the traditional sense.

### "It's a fire hazard"

**Response:** Level 2 EV chargers installed by a licensed electrician are no more hazardous than any other 240V appliance (electric dryer, oven). The City of Austin requires an electrical permit and inspection specifically to ensure safety. Provide your HOA with the electrician's license, insurance, and the post-installation inspection certificate.

### "It will impact property values"

**Response:** The opposite is true. Studies show that EV charging infrastructure increases property values and is increasingly expected by home buyers, particularly in Austin's tech-forward market. A 2023 study by the National Association of Realtors found that EV charger availability is a selling point for 40%+ of buyers.

### "We need to update our CC&Rs first"

**Response:** Under Texas law, the absence of an EV charger policy in CC&Rs does not mean installation is prohibited. The default is that it's allowed. You don't need to wait for a CC&R update.

### "Other homeowners might want one too and we can't manage that"

**Response:** That's exactly why a clear policy benefits the HOA. Offer to work with them to develop one. You can reference template EV charger HOA policies from the Electric Vehicle Association or similar organizations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can my Austin HOA charge me a fee to install an EV charger?**
The HOA can require you to pay for the installation yourself, including all permits and materials. They cannot charge you an additional "fee" or "assessment" simply for exercising your right to install under Texas law. However, if you need to run conduit through common areas, reasonable cost-sharing may be required.

**What if my HOA management company says they've never heard of Texas § 202.014?**
It's a relatively new law (2021). Print a copy and include it in your request. Most HOA management companies will escalate to their legal counsel once cited.

**My HOA says I need to remove the charger when I sell. Is that legal?**
HOAs can require certain disclosure when selling (telling the buyer about the charger), but requiring removal is likely unreasonable and may conflict with § 202.014. Consult an attorney.

**Can I install a Level 3 (DC fast) charger at my HOA home?**
Level 3 chargers require 3-phase commercial power, which most residential properties don't have. This is effectively impossible for most homes. Level 2 (240V) is the standard for residential.

**Does the Austin Energy rebate apply in HOA communities?**
Yes. Austin Energy's rebate is based on the property address and charger installation, not the HOA status. As long as you're an Austin Energy customer and use a qualifying charger, you're eligible.

**My HOA approved the charger but wants me to use a specific brand. Do I have to?**
HOAs can require "reasonable" aesthetic standards, which could include charger specifications. However, requiring a specific brand that's significantly more expensive than comparable options may be deemed unreasonable. Try to find a charger that meets their requirements — most modern chargers (ChargePoint, JuiceBox, Grizzl-E) look similar.

## Ready to Start Your HOA EV Charger Installation?

The process is manageable with the right preparation. Here's what to do next:

1. **Get an electrician quote first** — You need this for your HOA request anyway, and it helps clarify costs and logistics before you commit
2. **Gather your CC&Rs** — Review what your HOA actually says before assuming the worst
3. **Submit your request letter** — Use the template above, send certified mail
4. **Apply for the Austin Energy rebate early** — You must apply BEFORE installation to be eligible
